# 4. Global Business Rules

## 4.1 Company Scoping

The company scoping mechanism is a foundational element of Construct X that ensures proper data segregation and security across the platform.

### Core Principles

1. **Company-Based Data Ownership**
   - All primary data entities (Leads, Bids, Projects, Documents, etc.) MUST belong to a specific `companyId`
   - This ownership determines data visibility and access rights
   - Data cannot exist without a company association

2. **User-Company Association**
   - Users must be associated with at least one company to access the system
   - Users can belong to multiple companies with different roles in each
   - A user's access to data is determined by their company membership and role

3. **Active Company Context**
   - Users with multiple company associations must select an active company context
   - The active context determines which company's data is visible and accessible
   - Switching contexts changes the visible dataset for the user
   - The active company context is prominently displayed in the UI

### Implementation Requirements

1. **Company Selection Interface**
   - Users belonging to multiple companies must be prompted to select a company after login
   - A company switcher component must be accessible from all pages
   - The active company must be clearly indicated in the UI header

2. **Data Access Control**
   - All API endpoints must validate the user's company association
   - Requests must include the active company context
   - Backend services must filter data based on company ownership
   - Cross-company data access must be explicitly permitted through project participation

3. **Data Creation Rules**
   - All new data entities must be associated with the user's active company
   - The company association must be immutable after creation
   - Batch operations must respect company boundaries

4. **Multi-Company Collaboration**
   - Project-scoped data can be shared across companies through project participation
   - Participating companies can only access project-scoped data, not company-scoped data
   - Data visibility for participating companies is determined by project roles

## 4.2 User Authentication & Authorization

The authentication and authorization system ensures secure access to the platform and enforces appropriate permissions based on user roles.

### Authentication Requirements

1. **User Identity Verification**
   - Access to any module or data requires a valid, authenticated user session
   - Authentication must use JWT (JSON Web Token) for stateless verification
   - Tokens must include user identity, permissions, and expiration
   - Token refresh mechanism must be implemented for extended sessions

2. **Authentication Methods**
   - Email/password authentication with strong password requirements
   - Support for multi-factor authentication (MFA)
   - Single sign-on (SSO) integration capability for enterprise customers
   - Secure password recovery workflow

3. **Session Management**
   - Automatic session timeout after period of inactivity
   - Ability to maintain sessions across devices with "Remember Me" functionality
   - Forced re-authentication for sensitive operations
   - Audit logging of authentication events

### Authorization Framework

1. **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**
   - Permissions must be enforced at the API level
   - Two-tiered role system:
     - **Company Roles**: Define permissions within a company
     - **Project Roles**: Define permissions within a specific project
   - Roles determine CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) capabilities and access to specific actions

2. **Company Role Definitions**
   - **Company Admin**: Full control over company settings, users, and all company data
   - **Company Manager**: Management access to company data without administrative capabilities
   - **Project Manager**: Create and manage projects, limited access to company-wide data
   - **Sales Manager**: Focus on leads, bids, and contracts management
   - **Team Member**: Basic access to assigned projects and tasks
   - **Custom Roles**: Ability to create company-specific roles with granular permissions

3. **Project Role Definitions**
   - **Project Admin**: Full control over project configuration and data
   - **Project Manager**: Manage project execution without administrative capabilities
   - **Contributor**: Add and edit content in assigned modules
   - **Viewer**: Read-only access to project data
   - **External Collaborator**: Limited access for users from participating companies
   - **Custom Roles**: Ability to create project-specific roles with granular permissions

4. **Permission Granularity**
   - Module-level permissions (e.g., access to Submittals module)
   - Action-level permissions (e.g., create, read, update, delete)
   - Record-level permissions based on ownership and relationships
   - Field-level permissions for sensitive data

### Implementation Requirements

1. **Permission Checking**
   - All API endpoints must validate user permissions before processing requests
   - UI components must adapt based on user permissions
   - Permission checks must consider both company and project roles
   - Caching mechanism for permission checks to optimize performance

2. **Role Management Interfaces**
   - Company administrators must have interfaces to manage roles and permissions
   - Role assignment interfaces for both company and project contexts
   - Bulk role assignment capabilities for efficient user management
   - Role templates for standardized permission sets

3. **Permission Inheritance**
   - Project permissions should respect company role permissions as a baseline
   - Higher-level roles should inherit permissions from lower-level roles
   - Permission conflicts should resolve to the most permissive setting

4. **Authorization Failure Handling**
   - Clear error messages for permission denied scenarios
   - Logging of authorization failures for security monitoring
   - Graceful UI handling of inaccessible features

## 4.3 Data Validation

Comprehensive data validation ensures data integrity and consistency throughout the system.

### Validation Principles

1. **Multi-Layer Validation**
   - All data inputs must be validated on the backend
   - Client-side validation provides immediate feedback but is not a substitute for backend validation
   - Database constraints provide a final layer of validation

2. **Validation Types**
   - Required field validation
   - Data type validation
   - Format validation (e.g., email, phone number)

   - Uniqueness validation for identifiers
   - Relationship validation for linked entities
   - Business rule validation for complex requirements

3. **Contextual Validation**
   - Validation rules may vary based on entity status
   - Different validation rules may apply in different modules
   - Validation may depend on user role or company settings

### Common Validation Rules

1. **Identifier Fields**
   - Project numbers must be unique within a company
   - Email addresses must be valid format and unique for users
   - Reference numbers (RFIs, submittals) must be unique within a project

2. **Date Fields**
   - Start dates must be before end dates
   - Due dates must be in the future when created
   - Historical dates must be in the past

3. **Numerical Fields**
   - Financial amounts must be non-negative unless explicitly allowed
   - Percentages must be between 0 and 100
   - Quantities must be positive

4. **Text Fields**

   - Descriptions may have larger limits but still constrained
   - Special characters may be restricted in certain fields

### Implementation Requirements
