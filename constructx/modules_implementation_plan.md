2. **API Development**: Create RESTful endpoints for all required operations
3. **Frontend Component Development**: Build UI components using ShadcnUI
4. **Integration**: Connect frontend and backend components
5. **AI Enhancement**: Add AI capabilities using OpenRouter/Claude API
6. **Testing**: Validate functionality, performance, and security
7. **Documentation**: Create user guides and technical documentation

## Development Timeline

The modules will be developed in phases, with core functionality prioritized:

1. **Phase 1**: Core Project Management (Dashboard, Tasks, Documents)
2. **Phase 2**: Financial Modules (Budget, Cost Tracking, Payments)
3. **Phase 3**: Field Operations (Daily Reports, Safety, Quality Control)
4. **Phase 4**: Pre-Construction (Leads, Bids, Estimating)
5. **Phase 5**: Team & Resources (Resource Management, Equipment, Vendors)
6. **Phase 6**: Analytics & Reporting (Reports, Dashboards, AI Insights)

Each phase will include both frontend and backend development, with continuous integration to ensure all modules work together seamlessly.
