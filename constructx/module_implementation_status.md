## Implementation Priority
Based on the assessment, the implementation should focus on:

1. **First Priority**: Complete the partially implemented modules with full CRUD operations
2. **Second Priority**: Implement the core missing modules that other modules depend on
3. **Third Priority**: Implement the remaining specialized modules
4. **Fourth Priority**: Ensure cross-module integration and data flow

## Next Steps
1. Design complete CRUD operations and UX flows for all missing and incomplete modules
2. Implement backend models, controllers, and API endpoints for all modules
3. Develop frontend components and interfaces for all modules
4. Integrate AI capabilities across all modules
5. Ensure proper data flow between related modules
6. Test and validate all functionality
